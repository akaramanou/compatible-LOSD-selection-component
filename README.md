# compatible-LOSD-selection-component
The compatible-LOSD-selection-component is a software solution that implements an interface that facilitates the selection of statistical datasets for machine learning analysis. The software is based on R Shiny (https://shiny.rstudio.com/). The software allows users to (1) define the problem (i.e. select a response variable), and (2) select compatible datasets according to five criteria.
